# Web Portfolio

This project is a personal web portfolio based on the open-source template by [atlamors](https://github.com/atlamors/portfolio). The original repository provided a solid foundation for a modern portfolio website, and this version includes key modifications to improve its structure and styling.

## Key Changes

- **Migration from Next.js 12.3 to Next.js 15.1.7** for improved performance and long-term support.
- **Refactored files from `.jsx` to `.tsx`** to leverage TypeScript's static typing benefits.
- **Implemented Tailwind CSS** for more dynamic and efficient styling.

### New Libraries
- **Animation: `animate.css`**
- **Cuicui: [Watch library](https://cuicui.day/)**

## Acknowledgments
